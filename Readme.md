# 🧠 Employee SQL Analysis Project

This project contains a series of SQL queries written to analyze employee data. The queries cover a variety of SQL concepts including filtering, grouping, aggregation, subqueries, joins, views, and optimization techniques.

## 📁 Files Included

- `employee_queries.sql` — Contains all SQL queries organized and commented.
- `screenshots/` — Folder containing screenshots of query results.

## 📊 Dataset Schema

The project uses a single table named `employees` with the following columns:

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `department`
- `country`
- `center`
- `monthly_salary`
- `annual_salary`
- `job_rate` (out of 5, can be decimal)
- `sick_leave` (in days)
- `unpaid_leaves` (in days)
- `overtime_hours` (in hours)

## ✅ Concepts Covered

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Aggregate functions: `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `COUNT`
- Subqueries
- Creating and querying `VIEWS`
- Query optimization with `INDEXES` (where applicable)
- Filtering and ranking data with `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`

## 📸 Output Screenshots

Each query has been executed, and output screenshots are provided in the `screenshots` folder for reference.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Import the `employees` table into your SQL environment.
2. Run queries from the `employee_queries.sql` file.
3. View corresponding outputs in the screenshots folder.
